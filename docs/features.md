* Multiple output devices supported. 
* Integrate with [Amber Electric](https://mates.amber.com.au/NXX7QGMC?utm_source=amber&utm_medium=app&utm_campaign=AE537_Multi_Traffic_Generic&utm_term=&utm_content=referral_share_link) so that you can run a device (e.g. a pool pump) at the lowest possible rates.
* Supports switched outputs and meter only outputs.
* Integration with multiple Tesla vehicles to report on charging costs.
* Integrates with the majority of [Shelly](https://www.shelly.com) smart switches and energy meters to control and monitor you electrical devices.
* Dynamic Scheduling: Adjusts device operation based on real-time electricity prices.
* Normal scheduling: Turn devices on / off based on a time of day / day of week schedule, including support for dusk / dawn triggers. Schedule can be used for fall back if Amber pricing unavailable. Multiple schedules available.
* Override the output state using the webapp or an input line on a Shelly device.
* Support for complex output change sequences (e.g. turn on switch 1, wait for 20 seconds, turn on switch 2).
* Web app to view the current state of each device and manually override if needed. 
* Integrate with a UPS and control and output based on the UPS's "health".
* Historical Tracking: Maintains past days of device runtime to optimize future scheduling.
* Integrates with the [PowerControllerViewer app](https://github.com/NickElseySpelloC/PowerControllerViewer) so that you can view and chart status and history of all your output devices and meters.
* Integrate with multiple temperature probes. Switch an output based on temperature thresholds. 
* Set minimum, preferred and maximum operating times per day. Actual operating times are controlled by electicity prices and/or a predefined schedule. 
* Vary preferred operating times each month (e.g. run your pool pump for longer in the summer).
* Email notification for critical errors and excess eneegy usage.
* Integration with the BetterStack uptime for heatbeat monitoring.
