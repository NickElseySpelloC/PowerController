# Getting Started and Installation

PowerController is primarily designed to be run on either a Linux system, A RaspberryPi or an Apple Mac (Intel or Apple Silicon). Earlier versions have been tested on Windows 11 and since this is a Python application, this should still work, but the installation steps below will need to be adjusted.

Installation comes in several phases: 

1. Install the Prerequisites (Python, git, UV)
2. Prepare your Shelly devices
3. Install the PowerController application
4. Configure the PowerController application
